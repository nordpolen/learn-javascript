# Simple JavaScript Stopwatch

This is a simple stopwatch application built using JavaScript. It includes three main functions: `start`, `stop`, and `reset`.

## Functions

### Start
The `start` function begins the stopwatch. It records the current time and starts counting milliseconds.

### Stop
The `stop` function pauses the stopwatch. It calculates the elapsed time since the stopwatch was started and stops the counting.

### Reset
The `reset` function resets the stopwatch. It clears the elapsed time and prepares the stopwatch for a new start.

## Usage

1. **Start the Stopwatch**: Call the `start` function to begin timing.
2. **Stop the Stopwatch**: Call the `stop` function to pause the timing.
3. **Reset the Stopwatch**: Call the `reset` function to clear the time and reset the stopwatch.
